==========Object recognition============================================

----------Why object recognition is difficult---------------------------
Problems:
  * segmentation
    static image does not come with motion cue
  * lighting
    intensities of pixels
  * deformation
    hand-written characters
  * affordances
    chairs come with different shape serving the distinct purpose
  * viewpoint
    information hops between input dimensions

----------Ways to achieve viewporint invariance-------------------------
Approaches:
  i. redundant invariant features
  ii. put a box around the object and use normal pixels
      -> Judicious normalization
  iii. use replicated featues with pooling
       -> Convolutional neural nets
  iv. use hierarchy of parts that have explicit poses relative to camera

i. Invariant feature approach
  
ii. Judicious normalization
    pros:
      provide invariance to many degrees of freedom:
        translation, rotation, scale, shear, stretch
    cons:
      choosing the box is difficult
    * chicken & egg problem
      we need to recognize the shape to get the box right
  alternative:
    training with well-segmented, upright images to fit the correct box
    test time try all possible boxes in a range of positions and scales
