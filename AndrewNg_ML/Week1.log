Learning approach

1. supervised learning
  Regression
    -> predict a continuous output
  Classification
    -> predict a discrete output

features/attributes

2. un-supervised
  Clustering
  Non-clustering
    -> cocktail party problem


Framework
  GNU Octave
    -> learning tool / prototype tool

Model Representation

1. hypothesis
  h_theta(x)
    Training Set
	       |
	Learning Algorithm
		   |
	hypothesis (maps from input to output)
	
	Input --> hypothesis --> prediction

2. cost function
  J(theta)
