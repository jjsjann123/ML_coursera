--Classification--------------------------------------------------------
  y = 0 or 1
  regression will not work
  
  Logistic Regression: 0 <= h_theta(x) <= 1
  * this is a classification algorithm although it is called regression
  
--Logistic Regression---------------------------------------------------
i. Model
  h_theta(x) = g(transpose(theta)*x);
  whereas,
	g(z) = 1/(1+e^(-z)); # Sigmoid function / Logistic function

  interpretation:
	h_theta(x) = estimated probability that y=1 on input x
	           = p(y=1|x;theta)

ii. Decision Boundary
  predict "y=1", if h_theta(x) >= 0.5
          "y=0", otherwise
  h_theta(x) >= 0 --> transpose(theta)*x >= 0;
  h_theta(x) < 0 --> transpose(theta)*x < 0;

  transpose(theta)*x >= 0
	this is a boundary on space R(x)
	this is not necesarrily a linear boundary
